At the heart of our affection for cats lies the \npleasure we experience in observing their behaviour and in our interactions  \nwith them.\nCat ‘behaviour’ is defined as the way in which a cat behaves in response to a particular \nsituation in their environment. Behaviour is an external expression influenced by \nthe cat’s internal, emotional state at that moment in time. Their relatively recent \ndomestication from an ancestor shared with the African wildcat underpins the natural \nrange of cat behaviours specifically associated to and necessary for a solitary hunter. \nDespite being emotional animals, they lack some of the emotions specific to humans, \nwhich can lead to misunderstandings.

Conversely, \ncats are a predominantly solitary species. As such, we \noften find the interpretation of cats’ behaviour difficult. \nCats live in a much more scent-sensitive world than \nwe do. They use scent to orientate themselves in their \nenvironment as well as to detect and hunt prey. Cats \nalso leave signals in the form of scent for the purposes \nof distant communication with other cats. Cats don’t \nhave the ability to display complex visual signals such \nas facial expressions in the same way that we do \nas humans; they find visual communication tricky, \nparticularly in times of conflict.

All of these factors affect a cat’s \nbehaviour around food – a situation that causes many \nowners to describe a particular cat as ‘dominant’ in the \nhousehold.\nCats are very subtle in their use of space. It is common \nfor one cat in a multi-cat household to predominately \nreside upstairs while another cat lives downstairs. \nUnless owners draw up a house plan to examine their \ncats’ use of space, it can be easily overlooked. However, \nmost owners notice the change in their cats’ behaviour \nif one sadly passes away. Frequently many people will \ncomment that perhaps their ‘dominant’ cat died and \ntherefore the ‘submissive’ cat is behaving differently as \na result, and often talk of groups of cats ‘fighting for \nthe new top spot’ or ‘reorganising the pecking order’. \nCats do not form hierarchies.

Sadly, cat welfare is compromised in every case \nwith a failure to meet the five welfare needs.\nFrom a behavioural perspective, cats from hoarding \nsituations are unlikely to have been provided with \nappropriate resources. In some cases, cats may not \nhave been given any litter trays or outdoor access, so \nunderstandably these cats may show inappropriate \ntoileting behaviour. Cats that were born into a hoarding \nsituation may not have received adequate handling \nduring the socialisation period (see ‘Kitten socialisation’ \nsection for more information). As a result, they may be \nfearful of people and close proximity to people could \nseriously compromise their welfare.\nSociability towards other cats varies between cases. \nSome cats may actually be more sociable than the \naverage cat, whereas others may be so overwhelmed \nand chronically stressed by the presence of other cats \nthat they are best rehomed by themselves.

Before caregivers begin buying novelty items \nand expensive treats, here is a list of essential things \nthat kittens will need before they arrive. It’s important \nto remember the golden rule of one resource per kitten, \nplus one extra.\n• A food bowl\n•  A water bowl – placing the water bowl away from the \nfood bowl encourages cats to drink\n•  Food and water – ideally, continue feeding your kitten \nwhat they are used to, this will help them settle into \ntheir new home\n• A soft, comfortable bed and blankets\n•  A litter tray (with cat litter that they are used to \nusing), placed away from their eating area\n• A sturdy adult sized (not kitten) scratching post","metadata":{"source":"./public/behaviour-guide-2021.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Creator":"Adobe InDesign 16.1 (Macintosh)","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 15.0","CreationDate":"D:20220110160932Z","ModDate":"D:20220110161554Z","Trapped":{"name":"False"}},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:createdate":"2022-01-10T16:09:32Z","xmp:metadatadate":"2022-01-10T16:15:54Z","xmp:modifydate":"2022-01-10T16:15:54Z","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe InDesign 16.1 (Macintosh)","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:d7ea1bfd-6203-c047-ac13-6bc4012109db","xmpmm:originaldocumentid":"xmp.did:2e66be91-feca-4b5a-8148-fd7ae287539b","xmpmm:documentid":"xmp.id:9ed38775-d7ae-4b3e-b256-f18eb3094afc","xmpmm:renditionclass":"proof:pdf","xmpmm:derivedfrom":"xmp.iid:fa2b7f72-9916-44cb-b27a-631865785a2axmp.did:c7067b8c-6b1a-4a8d-a21e-6087c391470exmp.did:2e66be91-feca-4b5a-8148-fd7ae287539bdefault","xmpmm:history":"convertedfrom application/x-indesign to application/pdfAdobe InDesign 16.1 (Macintosh)/2022-01-10T16:09:32Z","dc:format":"application/pdf","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 15.0","pdf:trapped":"False"}},"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":77,"lines":{"from":30,"to":51}}}}],["f50d9249-0102-4cb1-b00f-f9430d9187a1",{"pageContent":"their new home\n• A soft, comfortable bed and blankets\n•  A litter tray (with cat litter that they are used to \nusing), placed away from their eating area\n• A sturdy adult sized (not kitten) scratching post\n• A cat brush to keep their fur groomed\n• A cat carrier – something well ventilated and sturdy\n•  New toys and games – a fishing rod toy is the perfect \nchoice for energetic kittens\n•  Plenty of safe hiding places – cardboard boxes, igloo \nbeds etc \nEncouraging appropriate play \nA common reason for cats showing aggression towards \npeople is due to learning at a young age that this is a \ngood way of interacting.

An owner may \nnotice that as their cat gets older, the cat may seem less \nactive and spend more time sleeping. \nThey may be less interested in play or grooming.
